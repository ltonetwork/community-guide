## Potential clients for LTO Network

### End clients

We have two products \(engines\). Even though we separate them only into two products, it's only from the technical perspective. In practice, they applied to the entire DTM market: Proof of Existence \(public chain\) and Decentralized Workflows \(private & public chain\).

#### Proof of Existence

This can be relevant for organisations that work with confidential data like documents/contracts, patents, permits, certificates or diplomas.  

* Examples of companies: [SignRequest](../../company-area/adoption/#signrequest), [Certik](../../company-area/adoption/blockchain-partners.md#live-contract-audits-on-blockchain-with-certik)

#### Decentralized workflows

This is relevant for organisations that collaborate on a single process with multiple parties, have a trust issue and need to validate each others actions. Logistics/Transportation, Governments, Insurance, Banking, Legal departments and public services deal with high administrative burdens can benefit a lot from this technology.

* Examples: [Dutch Ministry Transport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ip1d6BqTQU), [Public Services](https://medium.com/ltonetwork/ibm-watson-lto-network-to-speed-up-small-criminal-cases-by-400-22ddc80b9178)
* Possible prospects: governments, public services, logistics and transportation, healthcare. The applications are very wide, and the engine can be connected to legacy systems for smooth adoption

### Integrators

Companies which develop web applications that want to integrate blockchain for security reasons \(Data integrity\). Applications for inspections, files, documents, KYC, digital signing e.g..

* Examples: [Capptions](https://medium.com/ltonetwork/capptions-lto-network-user-experience-first-giving-blockchain-a-mobile-face-bec02dd16e17)

### IT companies and blockchain consultants

IT companies which build or integrate solutions for big corporates. Organisations which  have their own blockchain teams or smaller IT companies \(50+ employees\) with blockchain focus and experience.

More information on use cases is availabe on the [LTO Network website](https://lto.network/usecases.html).
