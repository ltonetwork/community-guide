# Social Mining

The power of a community is that every member is able to function as an autonomous actor and work for the benefit of that community. It's a more scalable and a more transparent way of working. With the benefits of the blockchain, economics amplify the effects of distributed work. 

You can help us with:

* [**Adoption**](business-team.md): bring clients and integrators to the network -&gt; [_chat_](https://t.me/joinchat/FmJTy0n6vjOFHWk9qHoZmw)\_\_
* [**Marketing**](marketing-team.md): write articles, spread the word around -&gt; [_chat_](https://t.me/joinchat/FmJTyxctTSOXRQKNechIKQ)\_\_
* [**Building**](tech-team.md): creating tools and Live Contracts -&gt; [_chat_](https://t.me/joinchat/BrVdbEUBdYOXu4N8mY9wEQ)\_\_

{% hint style="info" %}
As a community, we should demonstrate to others our serious approach and encourage everyone to talk about speculation as little as possible. **Try to get new members into LTO Network community based on substantial value of the project!**

### Be rewarded for your work

$$
Working + Holding = Rewards
$$

Genius math, right? Well, it's more complex than that, but you get the idea. 

It's not an airdrop or a bounty program, it's a living organism which **rewards active community workers**. Maning You improve your position if you are:

* getting more reputation
* holding LTO for longer 
* holding more LTO
* getting more points

The criteria like reputation and time of holding are the most important. Less so the amount of holding and the platform points. Altogether, they form an _index_ for every member individually. Then a mean number is taken across platform and a token amount is allocated to the entire participant list. Every community member can try to over-perform the mean index to get the best ranking by doing more tasks. The higher you are, the more you get. Think of it like Bitcoin hash rate. It's a smart system, where a big passive holder would get diminishing returns, which would make it fair for someone who cannot buy too much LTO, but creates value.

### Set up your account

* **Register** on the [**Community Platform**](https://community.lto.network/) 
* **Connect a wallet where you hold LTO** \(you need to own private keys of those wallet\). It can be either an ERC-20 or mainnet wallet. If you have mainnet LTO, you can also combine it with network mining. You need to hold minimum 1000 LTO.
* **Fill in mainnet wallet address for receiving rewards** later on. In case you already hold mainnet LTO, just keep that address.
* That's it! Share your work in the chat, and we will keep updating the leaderboard. If we missed some of your work - don't hesitate to send it again.

_The important feature is your rank, which predominantly depends on your reputation \(community involvement\). It's not as essential to climb higher every week or a month, as long as you maintain a healthy position within the community. If someones becomes less active, you take their place._
