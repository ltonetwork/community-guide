# Welcome Guide

![](.gitbook/assets/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif)

Instead of having a traditional token-related website, our main website [**LTO.network**](https://LTO.network) serves as a funnel for clients and blockchain integrators. To explain technical, marketing, token, and business aspects - we use this GitBook. **Let's make blockchain adoption happen here and today, together!**

## What's the secret sauce here?

* We have been developing software and blockchain products since 2015 -&gt; [more](company-area/company/) 
* Our solution is GDPR compliant, usually a huge challenge for blockchain technology -&gt; [more](company-area/about-tech/gdpr-x-blockchain.md)
* We have unique hybrid architecture with permissionless private chains -&gt; [more](company-area/about-tech/permissionless-private-chains.md)
* Our products are ready, our mainnet is live and it is used by multiple integrators -&gt; [more](company-area/adoption/)
* You can join our journey and earn LTO in the process - could you help with adoption, become a validator, secure the network, or build your own business on LTO Network? -&gt; [more](community-area/social-mining/)

With LTO Network, you don't have to be just a passive holder. **You can engage in daily activities, help us with clients, build tools - and earn more LTO in the process!**
