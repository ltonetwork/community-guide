# Advisors

We value long-term relationships with our community, investors, partners, as well as advisors. Therefore, our public board is limited to only few highly qualified individuals in each area \(technology, sales, finance and legal\). Taking that into account, we also secured long-term relationships with our advisors and the companies they work in, making sure our partnerships will last for many months going forward. Here is the [announcement](https://medium.com/ltonetwork/advisory-board-of-lto-network-nucypher-docker-cemex-cms-law-6a37da6e4d97) from 2018.

{% hint style="info" %}
For us, advisors are not just faces on the website. They have been helping us along the journey. **Alongside the public advisory board, we have dozens of very active and supportive community members who help us with adoption.** [You can become one](../../community-area/social-mining/marketing-team.md)!
